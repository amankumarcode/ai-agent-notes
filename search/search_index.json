I just want to use ChatGPT. A: Think of it like driving a car. You don't need to understand every engine part to drive, but knowing basics helps you drive better, troubleshoot problems, and understand why your car behaves certain ways. Same with AI!</p> <p>Q: What's the difference between SVD and eigendecomposition? A: SVD works on any rectangular data table (like Netflix ratings), while eigendecomposition only works on square matrices. SVD is like a universal tool that works everywhere.</p> <p>Q: Why do we scale attention scores by <code>1/\u221ad_k</code>? A: Imagine shouting in a small room vs. a big concert hall. In high dimensions, dot products become like shouting in a concert hall - they get really loud. Scaling helps keep the volume manageable.</p> <p>Q: When should I use cosine similarity instead of regular distance? A: Use cosine similarity when you care about \"direction\" rather than \"size.\" For example: - Document similarity: \"cat, cats, kitten\" vs \"CAT, CATS, KITTEN\" should be similar despite different lengths - Recommendation systems: Users with same preferences but different rating scales</p> <p>Q: How do I know if my data is suitable for compression (low-rank approximation)? A: Look at your singular values after SVD. If they drop quickly (like 1000, 500, 100, 50, 10, 1, 0.1...), you can compress well. If they decrease slowly, compression won't help much.</p> <p>Q: Why does my neural network training become unstable? A: Often it's a conditioning problem! Your gradients are too sensitive. Try: - Smaller learning rates - Better optimizers (Adam instead of SGD) - Gradient clipping - Layer normalization</p> <p>Q: What's the intuition behind eigenvectors?

A: The key difference lies in memory and inference capability. A simple reflex agent can only respond to what it currently perceives, making it helpless when crucial information is not immediately observable. A model-based reflex agent maintains internal state that preserves information across time steps, enabling it to make informed decisions even when key environmental features are temporarily unobservable. For example, in vacuum-world, it remembers which rooms are already clean without needing to re-sense them.</p> <p>Q: What happens if the environment becomes stochastic and the internal model becomes inaccurate? A: This is a fundamental challenge called model drift. Several mitigation strategies exist: (1) Confidence tracking - maintain uncertainty estimates for different state components, (2) Periodic validation - regularly compare predictions with observations to detect drift, (3) Adaptive updates - adjust update rates based on environmental volatility, (4) Robust rules - design decision rules that function reasonably even with imperfect state, and (5) Hybrid approaches - combine model-based reasoning with reactive fallbacks for critical situations.</p> <p>Q: How does the state representation in model-based reflex agents relate to the context mechanisms in large language models? A: They serve remarkably similar functions. Both maintain persistent information beyond immediate input to enable coherent behavior over time. LLM context windows store conversation history and relevant facts, while model-based reflex state stores world model information. Both face similar challenges: what to remember, how long to retain information, and how to update beliefs with new observations. The key difference is scale and learning - LLMs learn representations through training, while classical agents use hand-designed state updates.</p> <p>Q: Can model-based reflex agents learn and adapt their state representations over time? A: Classical model-based reflex agents typically use fixed state representations designed by programmers. However, modern extensions incorporate learning: (1) State space discovery - learning which features to track, (2) Update function learning - improving state transition models through experience, (3) Rule adaptation - modifying decision rules based on outcomes, and (4) Meta-learning - learning how to learn better state representations. This bridges toward more sophisticated architectures like reinforcement learning agents.</p> <p>Q: What are the computational trade-offs between state complexity and decision quality? A: There's a fundamental memory-computation-performance triangle. Richer state representations generally enable better decisions but at higher computational cost. Key trade-offs include: (1) State storage overhead - memory requirements grow with state complexity, (2) Update computation - more sophisticated state updates require more processing, (3) Rule evaluation cost - complex conditions over rich state are more expensive to evaluate, and (4) Diminishing returns - beyond a certain point, additional state provides minimal decision improvement. The optimal balance depends on domain requirements and computational constraints.</p> <p>Q: How do model-based reflex agents handle conflicting information from different sources? A: Conflict resolution is crucial for maintaining coherent state. Common strategies include: (1) Source reliability weighting - trust more reliable information sources, (2) Temporal prioritization - newer information typically overrides older data, (3) Consistency checking - detect and flag contradictory information, (4) Uncertainty propagation - maintain confidence levels and propagate uncertainty through reasoning, and (5) Multi-hypothesis tracking - maintain multiple possible world states when conflicts cannot be resolved. Modern AI systems like RAG implement similar conflict resolution mechanisms when integrating information from multiple retrieved documents.</p> <p>Q: What is the relationship between model-based reflex agents and the concept of \"system prompts\" in generative AI? A: System prompts function as initial state configuration for generative AI systems, much like the initial state setup in model-based reflex agents. Both establish the operational context, constraints, and behavioral guidelines that influence all subsequent decisions. System prompts can be viewed as a form of persistent state that remains active throughout an interaction session, similar to how model-based agents maintain state across multiple perception-action cycles. The key difference is that traditional agents update state through explicit functions, while LLMs update their \"state\" (context) through attention mechanisms and prompt engineering.</p> <p>Q: How do we validate that a model-based reflex agent's internal state accurately reflects the real world? A: State validation requires multi-faceted approaches: (1) Prediction testing - compare agent's state-based predictions with actual observations, (2) Consistency checking - verify internal logical consistency of state components, (3) Benchmark comparison - test against known ground truth scenarios, (4) Robustness analysis - evaluate performance under various model inaccuracy conditions, (5) Observability analysis - determine which state components can be verified through sensing, and (6) Simulation validation - test state accuracy in controlled environments before real-world deployment. This parallels challenges in validating the factual accuracy of knowledge stored in large language models.</p>"},{"location":"01_classic_agents/model_based_reflex_agent/#summary-and-future-directions","title":"Summary and Future Directions","text":"<p>Model-based reflex agents represent a fundamental architectural evolution in artificial intelligence - the transition from purely reactive behavior to memory-augmented decision-making.

A: Knowledge representation (rules) and control logic (decision function) are tightly coupled in the rule table. This makes maintenance difficult because domain knowledge changes require modifying the control structure, and vice versa. Modern architectures separate knowledge bases from inference engines to improve modularity.</p> <p>Q: How can a reflex agent be extended to cope with unseen percepts? A: Several approaches exist: (1) Add default rules with safe fallback behaviors, (2) Upgrade to model-based reflex by maintaining state, (3) Implement hierarchical rules with catch-all patterns, (4) Use similarity-based matching for near-miss percepts, or (5) Integrate with learning mechanisms to acquire new rules online.</p> <p>Q: Can simple reflex agents exhibit optimal behavior? A: Yes, in environments that are fully observable, deterministic, and where the optimal policy is stateless (Markovian). For example, a thermostat can be optimal if it only needs current temperature to make heating decisions. However, most real-world environments require state memory for optimal behavior.</p> <p>Q: How do reflex agents handle real-time constraints? A: Their O(1) decision time makes them naturally suited for hard real-time systems. Unlike planning-based agents that may exceed time deadlines during complex reasoning, reflex agents provide predictable, bounded response times essential for safety-critical applications.</p> <p>Q: What is the relationship between reflex agents and reactive programming paradigms? A: Reflex agents embody reactive programming principles: responding to events (percepts) without internal state management. Modern reactive systems like event-driven architectures and functional reactive programming extend these ideas to distributed systems and user interfaces.</p> <p>Q: How do we validate that a reflex agent's rule set is complete and consistent? A: Formal verification techniques can be applied: (1) Completeness checking ensures all possible percepts have corresponding rules, (2) Consistency analysis detects conflicting rules, (3) Safety verification proves that unsafe states are unreachable, and (4) Liveness verification ensures progress toward goals. Model checking tools can automate these analyses for finite state spaces.</p>"},{"location":"07_deep_learning/autograd/","title":"Automatic Differentiation (Autograd)","text":"<p>Updated: 2025-07-26</p>"},{"location":"07_deep_learning/autograd/#tldr","title":"TL;DR","text":"<ul> <li>Goal: Get gradients automatically\u2014no hand-derived math required</li> <li>Core idea: Record every elementary operation in a computational graph during the forward pass, then apply the chain rule backward</li> <li>Reverse-mode autograd (used for deep networks) computes all parameter gradients with roughly the cost of one extra forward pass</li> <li>Modern frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow 2, and JAX wrap tensors so this recording happens transparently</li> </ul>"},{"location":"07_deep_learning/autograd/#why-do-we-need-autograd","title":"Why Do We Need Autograd?","text":"<p>Training = tweaking millions of weights so the loss gets smaller.</p> <p>Hand-coding \\(\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w}\\) for each layer is error-prone and impossible at GPT scale.

A: Computational efficiency dominates the choice. Reverse-mode computes gradients w.r.t. all parameters in time proportional to one forward pass, regardless of parameter count. Forward-mode would require one pass per parameter, making it \\(O(\\text{num\\_parameters})\\) times more expensive. Since neural networks typically have millions to billions of parameters but scalar loss functions, reverse-mode provides orders of magnitude speedup. Additionally, reverse-mode naturally computes the exact gradients needed for gradient descent optimization.</p> <p>Q: What breaks if activations are not stored during the forward pass? A: Gradient computation becomes impossible or inefficient. The backward pass requires activation values to compute gradients via the chain rule. Without stored activations, you would need to recompute them during backpropagation, essentially doubling computational cost. Gradient checkpointing strategically addresses this by storing only some activations and recomputing others, trading computation for memory. Modern frameworks like PyTorch automatically handle activation storage, but memory-constrained scenarios require careful consideration of this trade-off.</p> <p>Q: How does backpropagation handle different activation functions, and why do some cause vanishing gradients? A: Activation function derivatives directly control gradient flow. During backpropagation, gradients are multiplied by activation derivatives at each layer. Sigmoid and tanh have derivatives bounded by 0.25 and 1.0 respectively, causing gradients to shrink exponentially in deep networks. ReLU has derivative 1 for positive inputs and 0 for negative, eliminating vanishing gradients but introducing dead neuron problems. Modern activations like GELU and Swish provide smoother gradients while maintaining non-linearity. The choice significantly impacts training dynamics and network depth limitations.</p> <p>Q: How do modern optimizers like Adam interact with backpropagation? A: Backpropagation computes raw gradients; optimizers determine how to use them. Adam enhances gradient-based optimization by maintaining exponential moving averages of gradients (momentum) and squared gradients (adaptive learning rates). After backpropagation computes \\(\\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L}\\), Adam applies: \\(\\(m_t = \\beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1-\\beta_1)\\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L}\\)\\) \\(\\(v_t = \\beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1-\\beta_2)(\\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L})^2\\)\\) \\(\\(\\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_t - \\alpha \\frac{m_t}{\\sqrt{v_t} + \\epsilon}\\)\\) This provides adaptive per-parameter learning rates and momentum, dramatically improving convergence compared to raw gradient descent.</p> <p>Q: Can backpropagation be applied to non-differentiable functions or discrete operations? A: Standard backpropagation requires differentiability, but several techniques handle discrete cases. For non-differentiable points (like ReLU at zero), we use subgradients or assign arbitrary derivatives. For discrete operations, approaches include: (1) Straight-through estimators - use identity gradients through discrete operations, (2) Gumbel-Softmax - continuous approximations of discrete distributions, (3) REINFORCE - policy gradient methods for discrete actions, and (4) Differentiable relaxations - continuous approximations of discrete functions. These enable gradient-based learning in scenarios with discrete components.</p> <p>Q: How does gradient checkpointing work, and when should it be used? A: Gradient checkpointing trades computation for memory by selectively storing activations. Instead of storing all intermediate activations, it saves only checkpoints (e.g., every \\(\\sqrt{n}\\) layers) and recomputes intermediate values during backpropagation. This reduces memory from \\(O(n)\\) to \\(O(\\sqrt{n})\\) with only \\(O(\\sqrt{n})\\) additional computation. Use when: training very deep networks, working with limited GPU memory, or processing large batch sizes. Avoid when: computational budget is tight, or network is already memory-efficient. Modern implementations automatically determine optimal checkpointing strategies.</p> <p>Q: What is the relationship between backpropagation and other automatic differentiation techniques? A: Backpropagation is a specific implementation of reverse-mode automatic differentiation for neural networks. The broader AD landscape includes: (1) Forward-mode AD - efficient for functions with few inputs, many outputs, (2) Reverse-mode AD - efficient for many inputs, few outputs (includes backpropagation), (3) Mixed-mode AD - combines both for optimal efficiency, and (4) Higher-order AD - computes gradients of gradients for meta-learning and optimization. Modern frameworks like JAX provide general AD capabilities beyond neural networks, enabling differentiable programming across diverse computational patterns.</p> <p>Q: How do computational graphs enable advanced features like dynamic networks and meta-learning? A: Dynamic computational graphs allow runtime graph construction, enabling flexible architectures. Unlike static graphs that must be pre-defined, dynamic graphs support: (1) Variable network depth based on input properties, (2) Conditional computation with if/else logic, (3) Recursive structures like TreeLSTMs, and (4) Meta-learning where gradients flow through optimization steps. This flexibility enables neural architecture search, adaptive computation, and algorithms that modify themselves during execution. The trade-off is slightly higher overhead compared to static graphs, but the expressiveness often justifies the cost.</p>"},{"location":"07_deep_learning/backprop/#summary-and-future-directions","title":"Summary and Future Directions","text":"<p>Backpropagation represents one of the most fundamental algorithmic advances in machine learning, enabling the training of arbitrarily complex neural networks through efficient gradient computation.
